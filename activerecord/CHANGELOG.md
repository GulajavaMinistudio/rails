*   Add `authenticate_by` when using `has_secure_password`.

    `authenticate_by` is intended to replace code like the following, which
    returns early when a user with a matching email is not found:

    ```ruby
    User.find_by(email: "...")&.authenticate("...")
    ```

    Such code is vulnerable to timing-based enumeration attacks, wherein an
    attacker can determine if a user account with a given email exists. After
    confirming that an account exists, the attacker can try passwords associated
    with that email address from other leaked databases, in case the user
    re-used a password across multiple sites (a common practice). Additionally,
    knowing an account email address allows the attacker to attempt a targeted
    phishing ("spear phishing") attack.

    `authenticate_by` addresses the vulnerability by taking the same amount of
    time regardless of whether a user with a matching email is found:

    ```ruby
    User.authenticate_by(email: "...", password: "...")
    ```
